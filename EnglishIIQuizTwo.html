		a: "-Incorrect- \n Explanation: \n A semicolon is used between two independent clauses that are usually related to each other. When using a semicolon, a conjunction (and, but, or, etc.) is not needed. \n Examples: \n “Josh picks the lemons; he uses a lemon juicer to get the juice.” is a correct use of a semicolon because it has two independent clauses that are joined by a semicolon without a conjunction. \n “Josh picks the lemons; uses a lemon juicer to get the juice.” is incorrect, because it doesn’t contain a subject after the semicolon.",
